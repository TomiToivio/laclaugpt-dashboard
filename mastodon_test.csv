The Nordic countries have very low crime and extremely low violent crime (the major cities in Sweden having the highest crime rates), and since except for Iceland we live in the middle of a tectonic plate there are never earthquakes. Outside of Russia glancing towards Finland sometimes there are no military threats.  
  
Everyone learns English starting from the first year of school and you can converse with anyone, altho some may be shy. Long term residence does require learning the language. Culturally people are generally cold to strangers of all ethnicities, but once you get acquainted with someone they are warm peoples. Speaking the local language also helps.  
  
I've heard other Nordic people say that Norway is the warmest and most open of the Nordic cultures followed in order by Denmark, Sweden and Finland. I've never spoken with someone from Iceland or the Faroe Islands so I can't comment.  
  
Taxes are comparatively high especially for wealthy people (it scales from 0 % to over 60 % including other fees, most having around 25 %), but I feel like people from less socialist countries dramatically undervalue free healthcare and free higher education.  
  
Some of the social benefits are unlocked once you have a residence permit (like iirc free emergency medical care), and once you have a citizenship (takes somewhere around 7-10 years of residence) you gain all of them afaik.

Listen, if someone has an opinion on [#Shadowrun](https://mastodo.neoliber.al/tags/Shadowrun), I'm gonna chime in.

The reason Shadowrun remained relevant while other cyberpunk [#TTRPG](https://mastodo.neoliber.al/tags/TTRPG) titles faded is that Shadowrun has always been woke. Racism and class warfare weren't just adjacent to the setting, they were the whole point of the game's world.

Punk is about the empowerment of the individual in the struggle against authoritarianism. Shadowrun always nailed the punk in cyberpunk in ways few other games did.

2. **EU Sanctions on Russia**: The mention of EU envoys working to resolve a block on new Russia sanctions indicates ongoing internal EU disagreements over how to handle the Russia-Ukraine conflict. This could signal either a tightening or loosening of economic pressure on Russia, depending on the outcome.

Abstract: Decoding human brain activity from electroencephalography (EEG) signals is a central challenge at the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence, enabling diverse applications in mental state assessment, clinical monitoring, and human-machine interaction. Recent efforts have extensively explored EEG-based brain foundation models for generalized brain decoding, employing large-scale training on multiple datasets. However, most of these attempts struggle with generalizability and fail to achieve satisfactory performance without task-specific tuning due to pronounced inherent heterogeneity among decoding tasks. To address these challenges, we present UniMind, a general-purpose EEG foundation model for unified multi-task brain decoding by uniquely unleashing the power of large language models to comprehend complex neural patterns. UniMind offers several advantages. First, we design a Neuro-Language Connector to bridge the modality gap between neural signals and large language models, distilling and transforming the spatiotemporal neural patterns of EEG data into representations understandable by language models. Second, a Task-aware Query Selection module is proposed to inject task-awareness into the cross-modal alignment by dynamically generating task-adaptive query tokens, enabling learning of task-relevant neural patterns across diverse tasks. Extensive experiments across ten datasets demonstrate that UniMind substantially outperforms state-of-the-art multi-task decoding models, with an average gain of 12 percent, while also offering valuable neuroscientific insights into neural functional correlations across tasks. The code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Lucrative career prospects and creative opportunities often attract students to enroll in computer science majors and pursue advanced studies in the field. Consequently, there has been a significant surge in enrollment in computer science courses, resulting in large class sizes that can range from hundreds to even thousands of students. A common challenge in such large classrooms is the lack of engagement between students and both the instructor and the learning material. However, with advancements in technology and improvements in large language models (LLMs), there is a considerable opportunity to utilize LLM-based AI models, such as conversational artificial intelligence (CAI), to enhance student engagement with learning content in large classes. To explore the potential of CAI to support engagement, especially with learning content, we designed an activity in a software Engineering course (with a large class size) where students used CAI for an in-class activity. We conducted a within-subject investigation in a large classroom at a US university where we compared student engagement during an in-class activity that used CAI tool vs. one without CAI tool. The CAI tool we used was ChatGPT due to its widespread popularity and familiarity. Our results indicate that CAI (ChatGPT) has the potential to support engagement with learning content during in-class activities, especially in large class sizes. We further discuss the implications of our findings.

Abstract: The rapid growth of edge devices has driven the demand for deploying artificial intelligence (AI) at the edge, giving rise to Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) and its evolving counterpart, Tiny Deep Learning (TinyDL). While TinyML initially focused on enabling simple inference tasks on microcontrollers, the emergence of TinyDL marks a paradigm shift toward deploying deep learning models on severely resource-constrained hardware. This survey presents a comprehensive overview of the transition from TinyML to TinyDL, encompassing architectural innovations, hardware platforms, model optimization techniques, and software toolchains. We analyze state-of-the-art methods in quantization, pruning, and neural architecture search (NAS), and examine hardware trends from MCUs to dedicated neural accelerators. Furthermore, we categorize software deployment frameworks, compilers, and AutoML tools enabling practical on-device learning. Applications across domains such as computer vision, audio recognition, healthcare, and industrial monitoring are reviewed to illustrate the real-world impact of TinyDL. Finally, we identify emerging directions including neuromorphic computing, federated TinyDL, edge-native foundation models, and domain-specific co-design approaches. This survey aims to serve as a foundational resource for researchers and practitioners, offering a holistic view of the ecosystem and laying the groundwork for future advancements in edge AI.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly being integrated into critical systems across various domains, from healthcare to autonomous vehicles. While its integration brings immense benefits, it also introduces significant risks, including those arising from AI misuse. Within the discourse on managing these risks, the terms ""AI Safety"" and ""AI Security"" are often used, sometimes interchangeably, resulting in conceptual confusion. This paper aims to demystify the distinction and delineate the precise research boundaries between AI Safety and AI Security. We provide rigorous definitions, outline their respective research focuses, and explore their interdependency, including how security breaches can precipitate safety failures and vice versa. Using clear analogies from message transmission and building construction, we illustrate these distinctions. Clarifying these boundaries is crucial for guiding precise research directions, fostering effective cross-disciplinary collaboration, enhancing policy effectiveness, and ultimately, promoting the deployment of trustworthy AI systems.

Ratings are updated via pairwise truth-aligned utility comparisons, and belief updates preserve measurable consistency and stochastic convergence. We introduce hash-based cryptographic identity commitments to ensure traceability, alongside causal inference operators using do-calculus. Formal theorems on convergence, robustness, and evolutionary stability are provided. The system establishes truth as an evolutionary attractor, demonstrating that verifiable knowledge arises from adversarial epistemic pressure within a computable, self-regulating swarm.

Abstract: Climate change and natural disasters are recognized as worldwide challenges requiring complex and efficient ecosystems to deal with social, economic, and environmental effects. This chapter advocates a holistic approach, distinguishing preparedness, emergency responses, and postcrisis phases. The role of the Early Warning System (EWS), Risk modeling and mitigation measures are particularly emphasized. The chapter reviews the various Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabler technologies that can be leveraged at each phase, focusing on the INFORM risk framework and EWSs. Emergency communication and psychological risk perception have been emphasized in emergency response times. Finally, a set of case studies from Nordic countries has been highlighted.

Abstract: The revolutionary advancement of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) has fundamentally transformed the landscape of visual content creation and artistic expression. While remarkable progress has been made in image generation and style transfer, the underlying mechanisms and aesthetic implications of these technologies remain insufficiently understood. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of AIGC technologies in visual arts, tracing their evolution from early algorithmic frameworks to contemporary deep generative models. We identify three pivotal paradigms: Variational Autoencoders (VAE), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Diffusion Models, and examine their roles in bridging the gap between human creativity and machine synthesis. To support our analysis, we systematically review over 500 research papers published in the past decade, spanning both foundational developments and state-of-the-art innovations. Furthermore, we propose a multidimensional evaluation framework that incorporates Technical Innovation, Artistic Merit, Visual Quality, Computational Efficiency, and Creative Potential. Our findings reveal both the transformative capacities and current limitations of AIGC systems, emphasizing their profound impact on the future of creative practices. Through this extensive synthesis, we offer a unified perspective on the convergence of artificial intelligence and artistic expression, while outlining key challenges and promising directions for future research in this rapidly evolving field.

Sunday 24th September 1950 was a momentous day in Scotland. Just over 3 years after American aviator Kenneth Arnold sent the world flying saucer crazy, the Scottish local papers (the *West Lothian Courier* to be precise) reported the arrival of the phenomenon in this country, specifically over the Firth of Forth! (Except the paper only published once a week, so this breaking news had to wait until the next Friday…)

West Lothian Courier – Friday 29 September 1950

An Edinburgh Lawyer, Mr A. M. Leggat, and his family were on a Sunday drive to South Queensferry. They had just got out of their car and were watching a train cross the Bridge when they spotted something at a height of about 2,000ft, “*a cigar shaped object, moving east to west*“. Mr Leggat said that he joked to his wife “*it’s probably a flying saucer*“, at which point the object turned and climbed higher. “*It became a circle, with a quite definite dark outside rim*” he told the Courier, “*it looked exactly like a perfect smoke-ring. We watched it for about 2 minutes*.” He estimated it to be about 50 feet in diameter and that there were others who had seen it too. The *Daily Record* also joined in the reporting, its columnist *The Gangrel* scoffing that it caused “*no excitement amongst Edinburghers*” as “*almost anything leaves these chaps cold”*. The *Linlithgowshire Gazette* was dismissive too: it was a well known fact amongst informed locals, it said, that “*residents often observe similar phenomena under certain weather conditions, when the smoke from passing trains forms rings and rises up soon to disappear from view*“.

The Forth Bridge flying saucer? No, it is one of the piers of the bridge under construction on a mill-pond flat Firth of Forth. National Records of Scotland BR/FOR/4/34/457

In a very strange coincidence, just the week before, another local paper – the *Falkirk Herald* – announced that the new B-movie *The Flying Saucer* was going to start running on the Odeon Circuit in the country from 9th October.

Flying saucers of a feather, flock together, and soon there were two: on Sunday 22nd October, Mrs Mary Mulvey, a newspaper seller, spotted three “*round dark-coloured objects with small tails*” flying over St. Andrew Square in the city. Her husband and a bus driver – Mr Bob Kirkhope of Lauriston Terrace – corroborated. “I saw three disc-like shapes fairly high up and travelling in the Daklkeith direction” said Mr Kirkhope to the Aberdeen Press & Journal. The resident meteorological officers at Turnhouse and Pitreavie airfields were scornful and said they must have been “*low cloud formations or weather balloons*“. But the folk of Annan and Peterhead begged to differ; they had seen them too!

Sixteen year old twins, Ann and Elizabeth Weightman of Newington Avenue, Annan, told the Sunday Post that they had watched them in the sky at night, approaching from the north and hovering over the town for 10 seconds. And in far off Peterhead, 15 year old schoolboy Ian Cruickshank of Prince Street, reported to the police that he saw a flying saucer “*hurtling across the sky*“, as reported the Dundee Courier. His mother said “*my boy was quite excited about it. It was quite genuine*“, her son adamant that “*It is no schoolboy joke. I had just come out of the house when a high-pitched whistling sound from the sky attracted my attention*“. His friends did not agree and he would tell the Courier that they teased him over the matter.

On 28th October, an un-named “*Glasgow Sunday paper*” received a report of a flying saucer over Kirkintilloch. They refused to print the story or be directly identified with it but the *Kirkintilloch Herald* didn’t! The paper joked that as a dry town (i.e. there was no sale of alcohol on public premises in the town, until 1967) that the only flying saucer was the head of the man who came home late and drunk from the fair. There would be no *Spaceships Over Glasgow* until Tuesday 5th December when a man came into the office of the Airdrie and Coatbridge Advertiser to report seeing a flying saucer over Raywyards (an area of Airdrie). The paper was able to correlate this with sightings over Glasgow and Loch Long shortly afterwards.

The craze inevitably reached the Kingdom of Fife, and on December 19th the Courier and Advertiser published a remarkable photo of an actual flying saucer over Leven municipal golf course!

Flying saucer over Leven, Dundee Courier – Tuesday 19 December 1950

But don’t dismiss the photo as a hoax, it was a real flying saucer: but just a flying model of one, the work of two young friends – George Russell and Don Beaton of Leven Aeromodellers Club,. The pair had been flying their saucer and shocking (and entertaining locals) over the course at the end of their string since May that year. The two were trying to rekindle interest in their club, which they had been members of when younger in the war years, and had ordered the plans of the *Sorcerer* model by mail order and built it, complete with tiny 2-stroke engine, themselves.

After this year of Saucery, things quietened down in the new year. They would flare up every once in a while in the next few years as a reported “sighting” would lead to copycats. The Evening News’ resident poet “MacNib” penned a humorous verse in response in July 1954

> Saucy Saucers.

> Those flying saucer yarns are back  
> Some say, a prelude to attack  
> By Martian airmen one foot high  
> Who guide these saucers as they fly.

> These little fellows have been seen.  
> With big eyes and a nose between.

> These flying sorcerors, as they’re called.  
> Are highbrow and completely bald

> “MacNib”, Edinburgh Evening News – Wednesday 7th July 1954

In November 1954, publisher Ian Girvan (of that town in Ayrshire) formed *Flying Saucer Service Ltd.* to act as a receiving and clearing house for information on UFOs. His business partners were Desmond Leslie and George Adamski, authors of the best-selling *Flying Saucers Have Landed*. As well as being a prominent UFO-ologist, Ian Girvan (also known as Waveney Girvan) was immersed in right wing politics, having been in the British People’s Party, National Front and Independent Nationalists movements. He nonetheless found time to publish the quarterly *Flying Saucer Review* until his death in October 1964.

Air Marshal Hugh Dowding: from the collections of the Imperial War Museums (collection no. 4700-27)

In May 1955, Girvan and his partners received the unlikely support of the otherwise sober and unimpeachable figure of Lord Dowding, (Air Chief Marshall High Dowding, 1st Baron Dowding, GCB, GCVO, CMG), the former Commander-in-Chief of the RAF Fighter Command during the Battle of Britain. Dowding, a national hero credited with a crucial role in the air defence of the nation, shocked everyone and verified to the Daily Sketch paper that the reports from February 1954 of a flying saucer that had landed at Lossiemouth in Morayshire and where a “Martian” had made contact with the witnesses, who had taken photographs, were all true. Dowding had apparently been won over to the belief of flying saucers by Desmond Leslie, *Flying Saucers Have Landed* co-author and partner in the *Flying Saucer Service*, and became a firm UFO believer in later life.

The Lossiemouth Flying Saucer, from “Flying Saucer from Mars” by Cederic Allingham

But Dowding’s bold Lossiemouth claim was actually the result of him being the victim of an elaborate and highly convincing hoax by *Cedric Allingham*, a fictional figure created by Peter Davies and his friend one Patrick Moore (yes, that Patrick Moore), to take advantage of the gullibility of the British UFO-ologist scene. *Cederic Allingham* fabricated a photograph of the Lossiemouth UFO and “Martian” and also a corroborating, sworn statement from an entirely fictitious but unimpeachable witness, local fisherman James Duncan. He published these claims and other verifying evidence in apopular 152 page book, *Flying Saucer From Mars*.

Cover of Flying Saucer from Mars. An Eyewitness Account of the Landing of a Martian, by Cedric Allingham

Allingham’s blury photo of the “Martian” he claimed to have met at Lossiemouth looked remarkably like a photo of Peter Davies with his back to the camera wearing an outfit including suspenders… But somehow Dowding, who had proved a dedicated, single-minded and organisational mastermind at Fighter Command, was taken in by it.

Alligham’s “Martian” photograph taken at Lossiemouth, from Flying Saucer From Mars

It was probably Patrick Moore who wrote the book, and he even acknowledged “meeting” with Allingham to lend credence to his existence. But he and Peter Davies sensibly denied all knowledge of it and made sure that their creation was impossible to pin down for interviews or meetings. But Dowding wouldn’t take no for an answer and used his personal reputation to track down the understandably elusive Cederic Allingham, and to convince him to give a lecture to his local Flying Saucer Club in Tunbridge wells. Moore and Davies were backed into a corner by Dowding and it would prove necessary for Allingham to appear if they were to maintain their illusion. And so appear he did, to deliver the lecture to a triumphant Dowding. Except it was actually Peter Davies in a false moustache

Cederic Allingham (actually Peter Davies), with one of Patrick Moore’s telescopes.

Moore and Davies would keep up their silent pretence for over 30 years, long after Dowding had died, before other authors pieced the rather obvious clues together and identified them. Moore was careful to never completely confirm his part in it, despite convincing proof  to the contrary (including the photo of Davies as Allingham, in his garden with his telescope).

Abstract: Open Radio Access Network (RAN) is a key paradigm to attain unprecedented flexibility of the RAN via disaggregation and Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based applications called xApps. In dense areas with many active RAN nodes, compute resources are engineered to support potentially hundreds of xApps monitoring and controlling the RAN to achieve operator's intents. However, such resources might become underutilized during low-traffic periods, where most cells are sleeping and, given the reduced RAN complexity, only a few xApps are needed for its control. In this paper, we propose CORMO-RAN, a data-driven orchestrator that dynamically activates compute nodes based on xApp load to save energy, and performs lossless migration of xApps from nodes to be turned off to active ones while ensuring xApp availability during migration. CORMO-RAN tackles the trade-off among service availability, scalability, and energy consumption while (i) preserving xApps' internal state to prevent RAN performance degradation during migration; (ii) accounting for xApp diversity in state size and timing constraints; and (iii) implementing several migration strategies and providing guidelines on best strategies to use based on resource availability and requirements. We prototype CORMO-RAN as an rApp, and experimentally evaluate it on an O-RAN private 5G testbed hosted on a Red Hat OpenShift cluster with commercial radio units. Results demonstrate that CORMO-RAN is effective in minimizing energy consumption of the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) cluster, yielding up to 64% energy saving when compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: When artificial intelligence mistakes memorization for intelligence, it creates a dangerous mirage of reasoning. Existing studies treat memorization and self-knowledge deficits in LLMs as separate issues and do not recognize an intertwining link that degrades the trustworthiness of LLM responses. In our study, we utilize a novel framework to ascertain if LLMs genuinely learn reasoning patterns from training data or merely memorize them to assume competence across problems of similar complexity focused on STEM domains. Our analysis shows a noteworthy problem in generalization: LLMs draw confidence from memorized solutions to infer a higher self-knowledge about their reasoning ability, which manifests as an over 45% inconsistency in feasibility assessments when faced with self-validated, logically coherent task perturbations. This effect is most pronounced in science and medicine domains, which tend to have maximal standardized jargon and problems, further confirming our approach. Significant wavering within the self-knowledge of LLMs also shows flaws in current architectures and training patterns, highlighting the need for techniques that ensure a balanced, consistent stance on models' perceptions of their own knowledge for maximum AI explainability and trustworthiness.

Abstract: Simulation-driven development of intelligent machines benefits from artificial terrains with controllable, well-defined characteristics. However, most existing tools for terrain generation focus on artist-driven workflows and visual realism, with limited support for parameterization, reproducibility, or scripting. We present a modular, Python-based library for procedural terrain generation that enables users to construct complex, parameterized terrains by chaining together simple modules. The system supports both structured and noise-based terrain elements, and integrates with Blender for rendering and object placement. The framework is designed to support applications such as generating synthetic terrains for training machine learning models or producing ground truth for perception tasks. By using a minimal but extensible set of modules, the system achieves high flexibility while remaining easy to configure and expand. We demonstrate that this enables fine-grained control over features such as slope, roughness, and the number of rocks, as well as extension to additional measures. This makes it well suited for workflows that demand reproducibility, variation, and integration with automated pipelines.

Abstract: The rising use of educational tools controlled by artificial intelligence (AI) has provoked a debate about their proficiency. While intrinsic proficiency, especially in tasks such as grading, has been measured and studied extensively, perceived proficiency remains underexplored. Here it is shown through Monte Carlo multi-agent simulations that trust networks among students influence their perceptions of the proficiency of an AI tool. A probabilistic opinion dynamics model is constructed, in which every student's perceptions are described by a probability density function (PDF), which is updated at every time step through independent, personal observations and peer pressure shaped by trust relationships. It is found that students infer correctly the AI tool's proficiency $\theta\_{\rm AI}$ in allies-only networks (i.e.\ high trust networks). AI-avoiders reach asymptotic learning faster than AI-users, and the asymptotic learning time for AI-users decreases as their number increases. However, asymptotic learning is disrupted even by a single partisan, who is stubbornly incorrect in their belief $\theta\_{\rm p} \neq \theta\_{\rm AI}$, making other students' beliefs vacillate indefinitely between $\theta\_{\rm p}$ and $\theta\_{\rm AI}$. In opponents-only (low trust) networks, all students reach asymptotic learning, but only a minority infer $\theta\_{\rm AI}$ correctly. AI-users have a small advantage over AI-avoiders in reaching the right conclusion. In mixed networks, students may exhibit turbulent nonconvergence and intermittency, or achieve asymptotic learning, depending on the relationships between partisans and AI-users. The educational implications of the results are discussed briefly in the context of designing robust usage policies for AI tools, with an emphasis on the unintended and inequitable consequences which arise sometimes from counterintuitive network effects.

Abstract: Transformer-based language models excel in a variety of protein-science tasks that range from structure prediction to the design of functional enzymes. However, these models operate as black boxes, and their underlying working principles remain unclear. Here, we survey emerging applications of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to protein language models (pLMs) and describe their potential in protein research. We break down the workflow of a generative decoder-only Transformer into four information contexts: (i) training sequences, (ii) input prompt, (iii) model architecture, and (iv) output sequence. For each, we describe existing methods and applications of XAI. Additionally, from published studies we distil five (potential) roles that XAI can play in protein design: Evaluator, Multitasker, Engineer, Coach, and Teacher, with the Evaluator role being the only one widely adopted so far. These roles aim to help both protein science practitioners and model developers understand the possibilities and limitations of implementing XAI for the design of sequences. Finally, we highlight the critical areas of application for the future, including risks related to security, trustworthiness, and bias, and we call for community benchmarks, open-source tooling, and domain-specific visualizations to advance explainable protein design. Overall, our analysis aims to move the discussion toward the use of XAI in protein design.

Abstract: Medical document analysis plays a crucial role in extracting essential clinical insights from unstructured healthcare records, supporting critical tasks such as differential diagnosis. Determining the most probable condition among overlapping symptoms requires precise evaluation and deep medical expertise. While recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced performance in medical document analysis, privacy concerns related to sensitive patient data limit the use of online LLMs services in clinical settings. To address these challenges, we propose a trustworthy medical document analysis platform that fine-tunes a LLaMA-v3 using low-rank adaptation, specifically optimized for differential diagnosis tasks. Our approach utilizes DDXPlus, the largest benchmark dataset for differential diagnosis, and demonstrates superior performance in pathology prediction and variable-length differential diagnosis compared to existing methods. The developed web-based platform allows users to submit their own unstructured medical documents and receive accurate, explainable diagnostic results. By incorporating advanced explainability techniques, the system ensures transparent and reliable predictions, fostering user trust and confidence. Extensive evaluations confirm that the proposed method surpasses current state-of-the-art models in predictive accuracy while offering practical utility in clinical settings. This work addresses the urgent need for reliable, explainable, and privacy-preserving artificial intelligence solutions, representing a significant advancement in intelligent medical document analysis for real-world healthcare applications.

Abstract: The distribution of galaxies in the Zone of Avoidance (ZoA) is incomplete due to the presence of our own Galaxy. Our research focused on the identification and characterisation of galaxies in the ZoA, using the new near-infrared data from the VVVX survey in the regions that cover the southern Galactic disc. We used our previously-established procedure based on photometric and morphological criteria to identify galaxies. The large data volume collected by the VVVX required alternatives to visual inspection, including artificial intelligence techniques, such as classifiers based on neural networks. The VVV NIR galaxy catalogue is presented, covering the southern Galactic disc, significantly extending the vision down to $K^0\_s=16$ mag throughout the ZoA. This catalogue provides positions, photometric and morphological parameters for a total of 167,559 galaxies with their probabilities determined by the CNN and XGBoost algorithms based on image and photometric data, respectively. The construction of the catalogue involves the employment of optimal probability criteria. 14% of these galaxies were confirmed by visual inspection or by matching with previous catalogues. The peculiarities exhibited by distinct regions across the Galactic disc, along with the characteristics of the galaxies, are thoroughly examined. The catalogue serves as a valuable resource for extragalactic studies within the ZoA, providing a crucial complement to the forthcoming radio catalogues and future surveys utilizing the Vera C.~Rubin Observatory and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. We present a deep galaxy map, covering a 1080 sq. deg. region, which reveals that the apparent galaxy density is predominantly influenced by foreground extinction from the Milky Way. However, the presence of intrinsic inhomogeneities, potentially associated with candidate galaxy groups or clusters and filaments, is also discernible.

Abstract: The invention of the transformer architecture has revolutionized Artificial Intelligence (AI), yielding unprecedented success in areas such as natural language processing, computer vision, and multimodal reasoning. Despite these advances, it is unclear whether transformers are able to learn and implement precise algorithms. Here, we demonstrate that transformers can exactly implement a fundamental and widely used algorithm for $k$-means clustering: Lloyd's algorithm. First, we theoretically prove the existence of such a transformer architecture, which we term the $k$-means transformer, that exactly implements Lloyd's algorithm for $k$-means clustering using the standard ingredients of modern transformers: attention and residual connections. Next, we numerically implement this transformer and demonstrate in experiments the exact correspondence between our architecture and Lloyd's algorithm, providing a fully neural implementation of $k$-means clustering. Finally, we demonstrate that interpretable alterations (e.g., incorporating layer normalizations or multilayer perceptrons) to this architecture yields diverse and novel variants of clustering algorithms, such as soft $k$-means, spherical $k$-means, trimmed $k$-means, and more. Collectively, our findings demonstrate how transformer mechanisms can precisely map onto algorithmic procedures, offering a clear and interpretable perspective on implementing precise algorithms in transformers.

arXiv:2506.18950v1 Announce Type: new   
Abstract: To address the challenges of untimely detection and online monitoring lag in injection molding quality anomalies, this study proposes a mixed feature attention-artificial neural network (MFA-ANN) model for high-precision online prediction of product weight. By integrating mechanism-based with data-driven analysis, the proposed architecture decouples time series data (e.g., melt flow dynamics, thermal profiles) from non-time series data (e.g., mold features, pressure settings), enabling hierarchical feature extraction. A self-attention mechanism is strategically embedded during cross-domain feature fusion to dynamically calibrate inter-modality feature weights, thereby emphasizing critical determinants of weight variability. The results demonstrate that the MFA-ANN model achieves a RMSE of 0.0281 with 0.5 g weight fluctuation tolerance, outperforming conventional benchmarks: a 25.1% accuracy improvement over non-time series ANN models, 23.0% over LSTM networks, 25.7% over SVR, and 15.6% over RF models, respectively. Ablation studies quantitatively validate the synergistic enhancement derived from the integration of mixed feature modeling (contributing 22.4%) and the attention mechanism (contributing 11.2%), significantly enhancing the model's adaptability to varying working conditions and its resistance to noise. Moreover, critical sensitivity analyses further reveal that data resolution significantly impacts prediction reliability, low-fidelity sensor inputs degrade performance by 23.8% RMSE compared to high-precision measurements. Overall, this study provides an efficient and reliable solution for the intelligent quality control of injection molding processes.

Abstract: Art curatorship has always been mostly the subjective work of human experts, who, with extensive knowledge of many and diverse artworks, select a few of those to present in communal spaces, spaces that evolved into what we now call art galleries. There are no hard and fast set of rules on how to select these artworks, given a theme which either is presented to the art curator or constructed by her/him. Here we present a series of artificial models -- a total of four related models -- based on machine learning techniques (a subset of artificial intelligence) that attempt to learn from existing exhibitions which have been curated by human experts, in order to be able to do similar curatorship work. We focus exclusively on the last 25 years of past exhibitions at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, due to the quality of the data available and the physical and time limitations of our research. Our four artificial intelligence models achieve a reasonable ability at imitating these various curators responsible for all those exhibitions, with various degrees of precision and curatorial coherence. In particular, we can conclude two key insights: first, that there is sufficient information in these exhibitions to construct an artificial intelligence model that replicates past exhibitions with an accuracy well above random choices; second, that using feature engineering and carefully designing the architecture of modest size models can make them as good as those using the so-called large language models such as GPT in a brute force approach. We also believe, based on small attempts to use the models in out-of-sample experiments, that given more much more data, it should be possible for these kinds of artificial intelligence agents to be closer and closer to the aesthetic and curatorial judgment of human art curators.

Abstract: The pursuit of efficient and controllable high-quality content generation remains a central challenge in artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC). While one-step generators, enabled by diffusion distillation techniques, offer excellent generation quality and computational efficiency, adapting them to new control conditions--such as structural constraints, semantic guidelines, or external inputs--poses a significant challenge. Conventional approaches often necessitate computationally expensive modifications to the base model and subsequent diffusion distillation. This paper introduces Noise Consistency Training (NCT), a novel and lightweight approach to directly integrate new control signals into pre-trained one-step generators without requiring access to original training images or retraining the base diffusion model. NCT operates by introducing an adapter module and employs a noise consistency loss in the noise space of the generator. This loss aligns the adapted model's generation behavior across noises that are conditionally dependent to varying degrees, implicitly guiding it to adhere to the new control. Theoretically, this training objective can be understood as minimizing the distributional distance between the adapted generator and the conditional distribution induced by the new conditions. NCT is modular, data-efficient, and easily deployable, relying only on the pre-trained one-step generator and a control signal model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NCT achieves state-of-the-art controllable generation in a single forward pass, surpassing existing multi-step and distillation-based methods in both generation quality and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable multimodal capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), discrepancies often occur between visual inputs and textual outputs--a phenomenon we term visual hallucination. This critical reliability gap poses substantial risks in safety-critical Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation benchmark and effective detection methods. Firstly, we observe that existing visual-centric hallucination benchmarks mainly assess LVLMs from a perception perspective, overlooking hallucinations arising from advanced reasoning capabilities. We develop the Perception-Reasoning Evaluation Hallucination (PRE-HAL) dataset, which enables the systematic evaluation of both perception and reasoning capabilities of LVLMs across multiple visual semantics, such as instances, scenes, and relations. Comprehensive evaluation with this new benchmark exposed more visual vulnerabilities, particularly in the more challenging task of relation reasoning. To address this issue, we propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first Dempster-Shafer theory (DST)-based visual hallucination detection method for LVLMs through uncertainty estimation. This method aims to efficiently capture the degree of conflict in high-level features at the model inference phase. Specifically, our approach employs simple mass functions to mitigate the computational complexity of evidence combination on power sets. We conduct an extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LVLMs, LLaVA-v1.5, mPLUG-Owl2 and mPLUG-Owl3, with the new PRE-HAL benchmark. Experimental results indicate that our method outperforms five baseline uncertainty metrics, achieving average AUROC improvements of 4%, 10%, and 7% across three LVLMs. Our code is available at <https://github.com/HT86159/Evidential-Conflict>.

Preprocessing steps include custom imputation, one-hot encoding, and standardization. Class imbalance is managed using SMOTE, and hyperparameter tuning is performed with GridSearchCV. The model is evaluated on multiple performance metrics including ROC-AUC, precision, recall, and F1-score. LightGBM emerges as the most business-optimal model with the highest accuracy and best trade off between approval and default rates. Furthermore, the system generates applicant-specific XAI visual reports and business impact summaries to ensure transparent decision-making.

Abstract: In the era of large-scale artificial intelligence, Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in natural language processing. However, they often lack transparency and generate unreliable outputs, raising concerns about their interpretability. To address this, the Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting method structures reasoning into step-by-step deductions. Yet, not all reasoning chains are valid, and errors can lead to unreliable conclusions. We propose ECCoT, an End-to-End Cognitive Chain of Thought Validation Framework, to evaluate and refine reasoning chains in LLMs. ECCoT integrates the Markov Random Field-Embedded Topic Model (MRF-ETM) for topic-aware CoT generation and Causal Sentence-BERT (CSBert) for causal reasoning alignment. By filtering ineffective chains using structured ordering statistics, ECCoT improves interpretability, reduces biases, and enhances the trustworthiness of LLM-based decision-making. Key contributions include the introduction of ECCoT, MRF-ETM for topic-driven CoT generation, and CSBert for causal reasoning enhancement.

===

A new site, FuckLAPD.com, is using public records and facial recognition technology to allow anyone to identify police officers in Los Angeles they have a picture of. The tool, made by artist Kyle McDonald, is designed to help people identify cops who may otherwise try to conceal their identity, such as covering their badge or serial number.

“We deserve to know who is shooting us in the face even when they have their badge covered up,” McDonald told me when I asked if the site was made in response to police violence during the LA protests against ICE that started earlier this month. “fucklapd.com is a response to the violence of the LAPD during the recent protests against the horrific ICE raids. And more broadly—the failure of the LAPD to accomplish anything useful with over $2B in funding each year.”

The ‘statistical image-making’ of Stable Diffusion and DALL-E derives its contents from large but ultimately incomplete datasets. The generated result is an average composite image that represents the machine’s idea of reality: six-fingered hands, distorted limbs, exaggerated body proportions and eerily smooth foods.

Medium Hot introduces a taxonomic framework for this visual phenomena – one that feels, at times, bloated and frantic in its categorical overlap. ‘Burnt-out images’ refer to works made from AI diffusion models, in which noise, or random data, is added to training data and then removed to generate an image. This diffusion process gives rise to what Steyerl dubs a ‘derivative image’, a term that echoes the concept of ‘derivatives’ in financial systems, highlighting the model’s extractive nature. Consider the derivative image a counterfeit version of the poor image. While the poor image attempts to skirt copyright limitations, the derivative image’s condition for existence is predicated on ‘large-scale data theft’. Steyerl highlights too the bias embedded in the AI means of production but ultimately resists the proposition that models should be inclusively reprogrammed on the basis that implementing diverse training data would only require more labour from microworkers and exacerbate the problem of data theft. AI thrives on disenfranchisement, contributing to ‘multipolar surveillance and… profound social disruptions’.""

Steyerl's resistance to 'inclusive reprogramming' underscores the futility of reformist approaches when the core infrastructure of AI is built on theft and disenfranchisement.

Um teilzunehmen braucht ihr einen Computer, das Alter ist relativ egal. Wenn es kein Laptop ist, haben wir auch Bildschirme, Mäuse und Tastaturen da. Aber achtet darauf, dass ihr **vorher alle eure Daten gesichert habt**. Und bringt bitte das Netzteil mit. Gute Laune und Stoppersocken sind optional.

Putin to skip BRICS summit in Brazil due to ICC arrest warrant

Brazil is a member of the ICC and a signatory to the Rome Statute, meaning it is obliged to arrest Russian President Vladimir Putin if he enters the country.

""Oil prices continued to go up and down as the conflict extended and rose again over the weekend after the U.S. got involved. But then, as Iran did not block the strait or otherwise interfere in the oil trade, prices started to drop — and swiftly. Even before a ceasefire was announced, prices trended down.

Now, crude oil prices are actually lower than they were before Israel attacked.

'The market has shown that it's been very resilient to some of the geopolitical shocks that historically would have sent prices skyrocketing,' says Angie Gildea, U.S. energy lead for the accounting giant KPMG. 'We didn't see that much with Russia-Ukraine, and we haven't seen that with Israel-Hamas. And we're certainly not seeing that in this case.'

Si alguna vez te has preguntado cuál es la diferencia real entre **Apple Intelligencevs Google Gemini vs ChatGPT**, o cuál de ellas tiene más potencial en nuestros móviles y ordenadores, no eres el único. Nos encontramos en un momento en el que la inteligencia artificial está transformando radicalmente la forma en que utilizamos nuestros dispositivos: ya no se limita solo a chats, **ahora la IA se integra en fotos, búsquedas, correos, productividad y hasta en funciones del sistema operativo**.

Decidir entre estas alternativas puede resultar abrumador, por eso vamos a desgranar **todas las diferencias, puntos fuertes, carencias y detalles importantes de Apple Intelligence, Google Gemini** (y su última versión Gemini 2.5), **y ChatGPT**en sus iteraciones más recientes.

**¿En qué consiste cada una? Primeras diferencias clave**

Lo primero es dejar claro **en qué consiste cada plataforma** y por qué la comparativa resulta tan relevante.

* **Apple Intelligence** representa la **apuesta de Apple por incorporar IA generativa y capacidades avanzadas en todo su ecosistema**: iPhone, iPad, Mac y hasta visionOS. Se presenta como un conjunto de herramientas nativas, con foco en la privacidad y una integración total en el sistema operativo.
* Por otro lado, **Google Gemini** es el núcleo de inteligencia artificial de Google, sucesora de Bard, que ofrece una **experiencia multimodal tanto en chat como en integración con servicios y aplicaciones**.
* Finalmente, **ChatGPT** (en su versión 4.5 en muchos casos) es el **modelo de conversación e IA generativa más popular y extendido**, desarrollado por OpenAI, presente en múltiples plataformas e **integrado con Copilot de Microsoft**, **además de**, recientemente, en dispositivos **Apple mediante Apple Intelligence**.

Las diferencias principales surgen en aspectos como: **funcionalidades, ecosistemas en los que se integran, modalidades de uso (chat, asistentes, reconocimiento de voz, etc.), privacidad y ámbitos de aplicación**. También varían en la capacidad técnica y en la forma en que almacenan, gestionan y recuerdan la información del usuario.

**Nivel de integración: ¿dónde y cómo se usan realmente?**

**Apple Intelligence** **está disponible de forma nativa en los dispositivos Apple más recientes**: iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 16, iPads con chip A17 Pro o M1 y Mac recientes. La idea es que la IA sea casi invisible, usándose en aplicaciones como Mensajes, Notas, Correo y en el sistema mediante una **Siri renovada**.

En cambio, **Gemini** **se encuentra en dispositivos Android modernos** (como Pixel), en la app Gemini para iPhone y en todas las aplicaciones clave de Google: Gmail, Drive, Docs, Sheets y en su buscador. **ChatGPT** **mantiene un perfil más versátil y menos integrado**, pero, gracias a la integración con Copilot y los dispositivos Apple, ha multiplicado sus puntos de contacto en diferentes plataformas y sistemas operativos.

En función del ecosistema en el que te muevas, **cada opción tiene ventajas**: si eres usuario de Apple, su integración es insuperable; en entornos Google, Gemini destaca por su omnipresencia y potencia; y ChatGPT es, hoy en día, la opción más flexible y polivalente, especialmente para quienes buscan un asistente potente tanto en web como en integraciones específicas (Copilot, apps de ChatGPT, Alexa, etc.).

**Privacidad y control de los datos: la gran baza de Apple**

Una de las principales razones por las que [**Apple Intelligence** despierta interés](https://www.actualidadiphone.com/llevo-10-dias-con-apple-intelligence-y-estas-son-mis-impresiones/) es su postura en privacidad. **Procesa los datos localmente siempre que puede**, utilizando “Private Cloud Compute” para tareas en la nube, garantizando que la información personal no se comparte con terceros ni siquiera con Apple. Esto ofrece tranquilidad a quienes valoran la confidencialidad.

En cambio, **Google Gemini** almacena información vinculada a tu cuenta de Google; puedes gestionar esto en «Mi actividad» en Google. ChatGPT, si bien puede gestionarse de forma anónima o con diferentes cuentas, es percibido como menos seguro en materia de privacidad, especialmente fuera del ecosistema Apple.

**Comparativa de casos prácticos entre Apple Intelligence, Gemini y ChatGPT**

En esta sección **vamos a analizar a fondo**cómo se comportan en la práctica las tres grandes plataformas de inteligencia artificial: **Apple Intelligence, Google Gemini y ChatGPT**. Para ello, hemos recopilado pruebas, referencias y comparativas de uso real, prestando especial atención a tareas cotidianas, productividad, calidad de respuestas, generación de imágenes y gestión de contexto.

Hemos seguido la **cobertura de IA de portales de referencia como [InformaTecDigital](https://informatecdigital.com/)**, así como evaluaciones independientes, benchmarks técnicos y pruebas de usuarios avanzados para ofrecer una visión objetiva, actualizada y clara. Nuestro objetivo es ayudarte a entender no solo qué puede hacer cada IA, sino**cuál se adapta mejor a tus necesidades concretas**.

**Calidad de las respuestas y casos prácticos**

La teoría es buena, pero ¿cómo se comportan realmente estas IA en tareas del día a día? La experiencia de usuarios y pruebas comparativas aportan respuestas esclarecedoras:

* **En tareas sencillas como “¿qué mes es?”**, Gemini y ChatGPT responden con precisión, mientras que Siri, de Apple, aún comete errores o requiere repeticiones.
* **En redacción y resúmenes largos**, Gemini Advanced y ChatGPT están en cabeza, especialmente en manejo de contexto, citas y fuentes. Perplexity también ha destacado en algunas comparativas por su equilibrio entre precisión y variedad de fuentes.
* **En generación y edición de imágenes**, Gemini (con Imagen 3) produce imágenes fotorrealistas o en estilos variados. Image Playground de Apple crea stickers y ilustraciones en estilos animados o de ilustración, pero con menor resolución. ChatGPT, junto a DALL·E, genera imágenes decentes, aunque con menor integración directa en apps.

En la práctica, **Gemini ofrece mayor versatilidad y profundidad en fuentes, aunque requiere supervisión, ya que puede cometer errores o inventarse datos**. Apple Intelligence es más estable y segura gracias a su integración y procesamiento local, pero en bruto es menos potente. ChatGPT destaca en creatividad y personalización, aunque su efectividad varía según la tarea.

**Memoria, contexto y continuidad**

Una de las diferencias técnicas más relevantes es la gestión del contexto:

* **Gemini 2.5 Pro** puede gestionar conversaciones de hasta un millón de tokens, permitiendo analizar bases de datos extensas, libros completos o sesiones complejas sin perder coherencia.
* **ChatGPT 4.5** maneja ventanas de hasta 128.000 tokens en su versión turbo, suficiente para la mayoría de escenarios, aunque se queda corto en proyectos muy largos.
* **Apple Intelligence**, al estar en el dispositivo y con acceso restringido, trabaja con contextos más reducidos, aunque presenta menos riesgo de pérdida de datos sensibles.

Esto implica que, si tu trabajo involucra analizar grandes volúmenes de información, **Gemini y ChatGPT tienen ventaja en retención y manejo del contexto**.

**Compatibilidad y multiplataforma**

El alcance en dispositivos compatibles marca otra diferencia importante:

* **Gemini** funciona en prácticamente todas las plataformas: Android, iOS (vía app), web y Google Cloud. Está presente en más de 150 países y soporta más de 35 idiomas.
* **Apple Intelligence** por ahora, está muy ligado a modelos recientes y en inglés o algunos idiomas en beta. Requiere iPhone 15 Pro/16, iPad con A17 Pro o M1 y las últimas versiones de macOS. Puedes ver más detalles en nuestra comparativa de dispositivos Apple en
* **ChatGPT**, gracias a su disponibilidad vía web, apps y su integración en Copilot y otras herramientas, ofrece la mayor flexibilidad en dispositivos y escenarios diversos.

La velocidad con la que Apple amplíe compatibilidad será decisiva en el futuro para igualar la presencia de Google y OpenAI en todos los ámbitos.

**Integración con ecosistemas y herramientas**

El uso cotidiano depende mucho de las aplicaciones y plataformas que emplees:

* **Gemini 2.5** se integra en Google Workspace: Gmail, Drive, Docs, Sheets, YouTube y Android Studio. Puedes gestionar correos, generar resúmenes y interactuar en modo voz o texto en tiempo real.
* **ChatGPT 4.5** funciona bien con el entorno de Microsoft: Word, Excel, Teams, Outlook y Copilot, permitiendo crear agentes personalizados y usar herramientas de navegador, imagen o Python.
* **Apple Intelligence** busca hacer lo mismo en el ecosistema Apple, aunque su integración con apps de terceros aún es limitada y dependerá de futuras actualizaciones.

Por ello, si tu trabajo se basa en Google, Gemini será la opción natural; si usas Microsoft, ChatGPT ofrece más posibilidades; y si optas por Apple, su avance promete, aunque todavía tiene recorrido.

**Productividad y gestión del correo**

Otra área clave es la gestión del email en nuestro día a día:

* **Apple Intelligence** ofrece resúmenes inteligentes de largos hilos, sugerencias de respuestas rápidas y priorización de mensajes en Mail, con opciones personalizables.
* **Gemini** ayuda a redactar, resumir y analizar correos, sugiriendo archivos relevantes desde Google Drive y otros servicios.
* **ChatGPT** y Copilot potencian la productividad con resúmenes, respuestas automáticas y ayuda en redacción, aunque su integración con apps de correo aún está en desarrollo y no iguala a las soluciones nativas.

**Creación y edición de imágenes con IA**

En el apartado creativo, la IA ha avanzado notablemente en generación y edición de imágenes:

* **Gemini (Imagen 3)** crea imágenes fotorrealistas o ilustraciones en diferentes estilos a partir de textos descriptivos, con buen entendimiento de prompts y detalles.
* **Apple Intelligence** con Image Playground genera stickers, ilustraciones y animaciones desde textos o imágenes, aunque en resolución y detalle todavía está por detrás de Gemini.
* **ChatGPT** con DALL·E permite la generación y edición de imágenes, pero con menor integración nativa en plataformas de Apple.

**¿Qué opción es más adecuada según tu perfil?**

La mejor elección dependerá de tu ecosistema habitual y preferencias:

* **Si usas Google, Gmail, Drive, Android**y quieres una IA integrada en tu día a día, **Gemini**es la opción lógica.
* **Si trabajas o estudias en entornos Microsoft**, valoras la creatividad y personalización,**ChatGPT 4.5 Plus y Copilot** te ofrecen más posibilidades.
* **Para usuarios de Apple** que prioricen privacidad y estabilidad, **Apple Intelligence**es la opción natural, aunque aún necesita ampliar funciones y compatibilidad.
* Los que alternan entre dispositivos y sistemas pueden aprovechar**ChatGPT o Gemini según la tarea y el momento.**

**Limitaciones actuales y futuro cercano**

Las tres soluciones tienen recorrido por delante. **Apple Intelligence** irá ampliando idiomas, países y dispositivos, además de mejorar Siri y la integración con terceros. **Gemini** **continuará perfeccionándose en precisión, contexto y multimodalidad**, y en futuras versiones de iOS se integrará más en dispositivos Apple. **ChatGPT** **evoluciona con nuevos modelos y más integraciones vía API, Copilot y asistentes personalizados**.

En el futuro cercano, veremos a **Siri convertirse en ese asistente inteligente prometido por Apple**, Gemini expandirá su presencia en apps y hardware de Google, y ChatGPT seguirá siendo referencia en creatividad y personalización. La colaboración e integración entre plataformas será clave para ofrecer a los usuarios la opción de elegir el asistente más útil para cada caso.

La inteligencia artificial pasará de ser una función adicional a convertirse en el motor invisible que potencia todos los aspectos de nuestra vida digital. La decisión final **dependerá de tu ecosistema, tus prioridades de privacidad y tus necesidades**: creatividad, productividad o integración entre distintos sistemas. El futuro se presenta emocionante y cada vez más inteligente",https://applesolutionss.wordpress.com/2025/06/25/apple-intelligence-vs-gemini-vs-chatgpt-guia-definitiva-y-comparativa-a-fondo/,applesolutionss.wordpress.com,"technology, artificial intelligence, privacy, digital life","This text provides a comprehensive comparison of three leading AI assistants: Apple Intelligence, Gemini, and ChatGPT.

by Brett Wilkins, Common Dreams  
May 24, 2025

""U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday signed a series of executive orders that will overhaul the independent federal agency that regulates the nation's nuclear power plants in order to speed the construction of new fissile reactors—a move that experts warned will increase safety risks.

""According to a White House statement, Trump's directives 'will usher in a nuclear energy renaissance,' in part by allowing Department of Energy laboratories to conduct nuclear reactor design testing, green-lighting reactor construction on federal lands, and lifting [#RegulatoryBarriers](https://kolektiva.social/tags/RegulatoryBarriers) 'by requiring the Nuclear Regulatory Commission ([#NRC](https://kolektiva.social/tags/NRC)) to issue timely licensing decisions.""

""The Trump administration is seeking to shorten the yearslong NRC process of approving new licenses for nuclear power plants and reactors to within 18 months.

""White House Office of Science and Technology Director Michael Kratsios said Friday that 'over the last 30 years, we stopped building nuclear reactors in America—that ends now.'

"" 'We are restoring a strong American nuclear industrial base, rebuilding a secure and sovereign domestic nuclear fuel supply chain, and leading the world towards a future fueled by American nuclear energy,' he added. [And radioactive waste!!!]

""However, the Union of Concerned Scientists ([#UCS](https://kolektiva.social/tags/UCS)) warned that the executive orders will result in 'all but nullifying' the NRC's regulatory process, 'undermining the independent federal agency's ability to develop and enforce [#safety](https://kolektiva.social/tags/safety) and [#security](https://kolektiva.social/tags/security) requirements for commercial nuclear facilities.'

"" 'This push by the Trump administration to usurp much of the agency's autonomy as they seek to fast-track the construction of nuclear plants will weaken critical, independent [#oversight](https://kolektiva.social/tags/oversight) of the U.S. nuclear industry and poses significant safety and security risks to the public,' UCS added.

""[#EdwinLyman](https://kolektiva.social/tags/EdwinLyman), director of nuclear power safety at the UCS, said, 'Simply put, the U.S. nuclear industry will fail if safety is not made a priority.'

"" 'By fatally compromising the independence and integrity of the NRC, and by encouraging pathways for nuclear deployment that bypass the regulator entirely, the Trump administration is virtually guaranteeing that this country will see a serious accident or other [#radiological](https://kolektiva.social/tags/radiological) release that will affect the health, safety, and livelihoods of millions,' Lyman added. 'Such a disaster will destroy public trust in [#NuclearPower](https://kolektiva.social/tags/NuclearPower) and cause other nations to reject U.S. [#nuclear](https://kolektiva.social/tags/nuclear) technology for decades to come.'

""Friday's executive orders follow reporting earlier this month by NPR that revealed the Trump administration has tightened control over the NRC, in part by compelling the agency to send proposed reactor safety rules to the White House for review and possible editing.

""[#AllisonMacfarlane](https://kolektiva.social/tags/AllisonMacfarlane), who was nominated to head the NRC during the Obama administration, called the move 'the end of independence of the agency.'

"" 'If you aren't independent of political and industry influence, then you are at risk of an accident,' Macfarlane warned.

""On the first day of his second term, Trump also signed executive orders declaring a dubious 'national energy emergency' and directing federal agencies to find ways to reduce regulatory roadblocks to 'unleashing American energy, including by boosting [#FossilFuels](https://kolektiva.social/tags/FossilFuels) and nuclear power.

""The rapid advancement and adoption of artificial intelligence systems is creating a tremendous need for energy that proponents say can be met by nuclear power. The Three Mile Island nuclear plant—the site of the worst nuclear accident in U.S. history—is being revived with funding from [#Microsoft](https://kolektiva.social/tags/Microsoft), while [#Google](https://kolektiva.social/tags/Google) parent company [#Alphabet](https://kolektiva.social/tags/Alphabet), online retail giant [#Amazon](https://kolektiva.social/tags/Amazon), and [#Facebook](https://kolektiva.social/tags/Facebook) owner [#Meta](https://kolektiva.social/tags/Meta) are among the competitors also investing in nuclear energy.

"" 'Do we really want to create more [#RadioactiveWaste](https://kolektiva.social/tags/RadioactiveWaste) to power the often dubious and questionable uses of [#AI](https://kolektiva.social/tags/AI)?' [#JohannaNeumann](https://kolektiva.social/tags/JohannaNeumann), Environment America Research & Policy Center's senior director of the Campaign for 100% [#RenewableEnergy](https://kolektiva.social/tags/RenewableEnergy), asked in December.

"" '[#BigTech](https://kolektiva.social/tags/BigTech) should recommit to solutions that not only work but pose less risk to our [#environment](https://kolektiva.social/tags/environment) and [#health](https://kolektiva.social/tags/health),' Neumann added.""

At a Nato press conference in the Netherlands, President Trump took a question from Myroslava Petsa from the BBC Ukrainian Service.

Constellation Energy is prepared to invest $1.6 billion to bring the plant's surviving reactor from the 1979 meltdown back online.

By Michael Tanenbaum, PhillyVoice Staff   
September 20, 2024

Excerpt: ""Tech companies favor nuclear power for AI

""In the race to develop artificial intelligence applications, tech companies are scrambling to build data centers, which require enormous amounts of electricity to operate. Such facilities are forecast to make up a growing share of the nation's electricity use in the years to come, prompting companies to look at tapping into existing infrastructure to help meet their needs.

""[#NuclearPower](https://kolektiva.social/tags/NuclearPower) is being touted as a cost-effective solution for these data centers that also limits reliance on carbon-producing power sources. Building and directly connecting data centers to nuclear plants is known as co-location, a strategy that industry leaders favor because it's cheaper and faster to do. Proponents also claim it reduces stress on the transmission grids.

[...]

""When Constellation signaled interest in restarting Three Mile Island in July [2024], doubts surfaced about the technical feasibility of the project. Not only would it be the first of its kind, but it will have to be accomplished next to another reactor whose clean-up and decommissioning is expected to continue through 2078.

""The site also remains politically contentious due to the lasting memory of the 1979 accident, which displaced surrounding communities and left a legacy of fear over whether the [#radiation](https://kolektiva.social/tags/radiation) released contributed to increased [#cancer](https://kolektiva.social/tags/cancer) rates in the vicinity. About 2 million people were exposed to [#RadioactiveFallout](https://kolektiva.social/tags/RadioactiveFallout) as a result of the meltdown.

""Public health researchers from Temple, Penn State and the University of Pittsburgh published a report last year finding that long-term studies into the impact of the meltdown were limited by research flaws.""

The post highlights the economic investment ($1.6 billion) which could be a key argument for proponents of the plan. Secondly, it brings up **environmental concerns**.

The use of hashtags like #waterislife and #nuclearpowerplants suggests opposition to the plan based on environmental grounds. Thirdly, it relates to **technology and infrastructure**. The growing demand for energy from AI data centers is a significant infrastructure challenge, and this post presents one potential solution.

At first they said that you are holding the console wrong  
A ton of people were complaining about it because that is an awful response   
They have since admitted they are wrong and are going to send people replacements once they figure if they can reasonably do a certain design

Outside of that, I havent used it too much so I cant really share many thoughts outside of it feeling a lot like the Steam Deck one, and the Steam Deck one feeling awesome to use  
Also modified the joycon grip that came with the console and I dunno, I like how there is no gap between the joycon grip and the joycon themselves (imo the grip with the switch 2 is a downgrade compared to the Switch 1 version)  
Ill probably share what i think once they send the replacements and I use it for a bit

Bertrand broke the story that more than 50 CIA officials signed a letter stating their opinion that emails purportedly written by Hunter Biden ""had all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation""

You want freedom? You want GNU/Linux to mean something?  
Then maybe start by not telling disabled users to go fuck themselves with a smile.  
This commenter thought they were defending ""software freedom."" What they were really doing was kicking people out of the room. Dismissing accessibility. Mocking effort. Pretending that cruelty is some kind of rite of passage. They quoted Stallman like it was scripture, ignored real-world experience like it was noise, and wrapped it all in condescension dressed as virtue.  
I’ve spent over a decade in this ecosystem. Writing patches. Rebuilding broken stacks. Helping blind users boot systems upstream doesn’t even test. I didn’t ""just install Arch and whine about the terminal."" I lived in it. I survived it. I held it together when maintainers disappeared and no one else gave a damn.  
But apparently, because I didn’t call it GNU/Linux™ and because I dared to talk about how this OS chews people up and spits them out, I’m lazy. I’m weak. I should ""get a dog.""  
So I wrote a response. Line by line. No mercy. No euphemisms.  
This isn’t just about one comment. This is about every time someone’s been told they don’t belong because they couldn’t learn fast enough, code well enough, or survive long enough. It’s about everyone who was pushed out while the gatekeepers patted themselves on the back for ""preserving the spirit of free software.""  
You want a free system? Start by making it livable. Because freedom that demands you crawl bleeding through a broken bootloader isn’t freedom. It’s abandonment dressed in ideology.  
And if this kind of gatekeeping is your idea of community?  
You can keep it.

<https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20104> <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20104> <https://arxiv.org/html/2506.20104>

Abstract: The Russian invasion of Ukraine has fundamentally altered the information technology (IT) risk landscape, particularly in cloud computing environments. This paper examines how this geopolitical conflict has accelerated data sovereignty concerns, transformed cybersecurity paradigms, and reshaped cloud infrastructure strategies worldwide. Through an analysis of documented cyber operations, regulatory responses, and organizational adaptations between 2022 and early 2025, this research demonstrates how the conflict has served as a catalyst for a broader reassessment of IT risk. The research reveals that while traditional IT risk frameworks offer foundational guidance, their standard application may inadequately address the nuances of state-sponsored threats, conflicting data governance regimes, and the weaponization of digital dependencies without specific geopolitical augmentation. The contribution of this paper lies in its focused synthesis and strategic adaptation of existing best practices into a multi-layered approach. This approach uniquely synergizes resilient cloud architectures (including sovereign and hybrid models), enhanced data-centric security strategies (such as advanced encryption and privacy-enhancing technologies), and geopolitically-informed governance to build digital resilience. The interplay between these layers, emphasizing how geopolitical insights directly shape architectural and security choices beyond standard best practices-particularly by integrating the human element, including personnel vulnerabilities and expertise, as a core consideration in technical design and operational management-offers a more robust defense against the specific, multifaceted risks arising from geopolitical conflict in increasingly fractured digital territories.

<https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20009> <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20009> <https://arxiv.org/html/2506.20009>

Abstract: Background The increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare has sparked growing concerns about its environmental and ethical implications. Commercial Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and DeepSeek, require substantial resources, while the utilization of these systems for medical purposes raises critical issues regarding patient privacy and safety. Methods We developed a customizable Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework for medical tasks, which monitors its energy usage and CO2 emissions. This system was then used to create RAGs based on various open-source LLMs. The tested models included both general purpose models like llama3.1:8b and medgemma-4b-it, which is medical-domain specific. The best RAGs performance and energy consumption was compared to DeepSeekV3-R1 and OpenAIs o4-mini model. A dataset of medical questions was used for the evaluation. Results Custom RAG models outperformed commercial models in accuracy and energy consumption. The RAG model built on llama3.1:8B achieved the highest accuracy (58.5%) and was significantly better than other models, including o4-mini and DeepSeekV3-R1. The llama3.1-RAG also exhibited the lowest energy consumption and CO2 footprint among all models, with a Performance per kWh of 0.52 and a total CO2 emission of 473g. Compared to o4-mini, the llama3.1-RAG achieved 2.7x times more accuracy points per kWh and 172% less electricity usage while maintaining higher accuracy. Conclusion Our study demonstrates that local LLMs can be leveraged to develop RAGs that outperform commercial, online LLMs in medical tasks, while having a smaller environmental impact. Our modular framework promotes sustainable AI development, reducing electricity usage and aligning with the UNs Sustainable Development Goals.

<https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20148> <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20148> <https://arxiv.org/html/2506.20148>

Abstract: Humans can possess good mechanics intuitions by learning from a few examples, which leads to the question of how to develop artificial mechanics intuitions that can be learned from small data, as we are eagerly entering the era of artificial intelligence. We propose in this Letter the sample-switchable training method, which successfully develops highly-accurate artificial mechanics intuitions that can master brachistochrone problem, catenary problem, and large nonlinear deformation problem of elastic plate by learning from no more than three samples. The model's intuitive prediction ability increases nonlinearly with respect to the number of training samples, suggesting that superb mechanics intuitions can be in-principle achieved based on a finite number of samples, reflecting how human brains form good mechanics intuitions just by learning a few cases. Our current work presents an alternative perspective for educating artificial intelligence capable of intuitively understand and predict how materials deform and move, a scenario that has been frequently seen in Science-Fiction movies.

Abstract: Peer-to-peer trading and the move to decentralized grids have reshaped the energy markets in the United States. Notwithstanding, such developments lead to new challenges, mainly regarding the safety and authenticity of energy trade. This study aimed to develop and build a secure, intelligent, and efficient energy transaction system for the decentralized US energy market. This research interlinks the technological prowess of blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) in a novel way to solve long-standing challenges in the distributed energy market, specifically those of security, fraudulent behavior detection, and market reliability. The dataset for this research is comprised of more than 1.2 million anonymized energy transaction records from a simulated peer-to-peer (P2P) energy exchange network emulating real-life blockchain-based American microgrids, including those tested by LO3 Energy and Grid+ Labs. Each record contains detailed fields of transaction identifier, timestamp, energy volume (kWh), transaction type (buy/sell), unit price, prosumer/consumer identifier (hashed for privacy), smart meter readings, geolocation regions, and settlement confirmation status. The dataset also includes system-calculated behavior metrics of transaction rate, variability of energy production, and historical pricing patterns. The system architecture proposed involves the integration of two layers, namely a blockchain layer and artificial intelligence (AI) layer, each playing a unique but complementary function in energy transaction securing and market intelligence improvement. The machine learning models used in this research were specifically chosen for their established high performance in classification tasks, specifically in the identification of energy transaction fraud in decentralized markets.

https://lgbtqia.space/@AeonCypher/114748814787907629,2025-06-26 08:52:40.000,"Why I Don't Spend My Time Policing Language

I wrote above about the erasure of femininity and I stand by every word. However, just because something is ""right"" or ""correct"" does not mean that every action taken in service of it is useful, strategic, or even desirable.

Language does matter. It really does. However, how we engage with others matters a ton more than language does.

We are living through multiple overlapping crises, and I've had to ask myself what kinds of acts actually protect people, build solidarity, and help us survive.

It is easy to fill our voids, our existential dreads, with self-righteousness. It is a temptation to quicken ourselves by finding the faults in others, especially when we know a community can rally around us.

Working with compassion and empathy is much much harder.

I've chosen not to spend my time correcting or policing others language (including misgendering me) not because I think the words are harmless, but because I think there are more urgent and effective way s to confront those harms.

The reality is that language is fluid and changes. Often times that fluidity isn't kind or fair. In fact, it generally will reflect the zeitgeist, which is neither kind nor fair to the feminine now a days. However, the reality is that ""guys"" and ""dude"" are becoming gender neutral terms. We can critique what the flow says about us, but fighting it is sticking your finger in the dam.

And the only way to fight it is to be prescriptive about language. Insisting that there is a ""correct"", ""proper"", or ""respectable"" way to speak is classist garbage, and often racist classist garbage. Asking others to speak in a certain way is actually just asking for them to conform to your in-group affectations.

I despise leftist groupthink. I hated Latinx before it was cool, and don't like ""folx"" either. I'm not conforming. But more importantly, what asking others to do by conforming, is telling them they are \_excluded\_ from the group \_unless\_ they conform.

This is outward social pressure away from progressive voices. This is selective pressure and purity politics in a lesser form. Call outs are not a mechanism for social change, but instead a means of creating cohesive group identity and providing a psychological reward to the person who initiated the callout.

Remember, language is mostly inherited fro our family, community, and peer group. A callout, or policing someones language, is to critique their social identity. People will inherently become defensive. At best they robotically do as told, and engage in performative correctness without examining their values. This is not justice.

Worse, it can create blowback. We are living through dangerous times. Any act which makes someone afraid to speak up is an act of despicable evil. The creation of shame, confusion, or defensiveness; making people afraid in any way, is driving them into the arms of fascism. I worry that by overcorrecting on small things, we push people away from bigger and more vital conversations.

In trying to ""win"" the battle of words, we are losing the war.

Ultimately, I've become more interested in effective politics than theory. I'm increasingly focused on strategy over performance. What is the most effective way to prevent queer youth from dying? To keep trans people from being legislated out of existence? To prevent women from becoming cattle? To prevent the collapse of our ecosystems and to push back against the encroaching authoritarian hellscape.

When I am serious about what that takes, it doesn't involve arguments about casual language. The fight requires empathy, DIY know-how, mutual understanding, and trust networks.

So, yes. Gender neutral dude is fucked up. No, I don't care if you use it.

Abstract: Educators and learners worldwide are embracing the rise of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) as it reshapes higher education. However, GenAI also raises significant privacy and security concerns, as models and privacy-sensitive user data, such as student records, may be misused by service providers. Unfortunately, end-users often have little awareness of or control over how these models operate. To address these concerns, universities are developing institutional policies to guide GenAI use while safeguarding security and privacy. This work examines these emerging policies and guidelines, with a particular focus on the often-overlooked privacy and security dimensions of GenAI integration in higher education, alongside other academic values. Through a qualitative analysis of GenAI usage guidelines from universities across 12 countries, we identify key challenges and opportunities institutions face in providing effective privacy and security protections, including the need for GenAI safeguards tailored specifically to the academic context.

<https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19958> <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19958> <https://arxiv.org/html/2506.19958>

arXiv:2506.19958v1 Announce Type: new   
Abstract: We present RobustiPy, a next generation Python-based framework for model uncertainty quantification and multiverse analysis, released under the GNU GPL v3.0. Through the integration of efficient bootstrap-based confidence intervals, combinatorial exploration of dependent-variable specifications, model selection and averaging, and two complementary joint-inference routines, RobustiPy transcends existing uncertainty-quantification tools. Its design further supports rigorous out-of-sample evaluation and apportions the predictive contribution of each covariate. We deploy the library across five carefully constructed simulations and ten empirically grounded case studies drawn from high-impact literature and teaching examples, including a novel re-analysis of ""unexplained discrepancies"" in famous prior work. To illustrate its performance, we time-profile RobustiPy over roughly 672 million simulated linear regressions. These applications showcase how RobustiPy not only accelerates robust inference but also deepens our interpretive insight into model sensitivity across the vast analytical multiverse within which scientists operate.

<https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20134> <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20134> <https://arxiv.org/html/2506.20134>

arXiv:2506.20134v1 Announce Type: new   
Abstract: World models have garnered increasing attention in the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI), serving as computational frameworks for learning representations of the external world and forecasting future states. While early efforts focused on 2D visual perception and simulation, recent 3D-aware generative world models have demonstrated the ability to synthesize geometrically consistent, interactive 3D environments, marking a shift toward 3D spatial cognition. Despite rapid progress, the field lacks systematic analysis to categorize emerging techniques and clarify their roles in advancing 3D cognitive world models. This survey addresses this need by introducing a conceptual framework, providing a structured and forward-looking review of world models transitioning from 2D perception to 3D cognition. Within this framework, we highlight two key technological drivers, particularly advances in 3D representations and the incorporation of world knowledge, as fundamental pillars. Building on these, we dissect three core cognitive capabilities that underpin 3D world modeling: 3D physical scene generation, 3D spatial reasoning, and 3D spatial interaction. We further examine the deployment of these capabilities in real-world applications, including embodied AI, autonomous driving, digital twin, and gaming/VR. Finally, we identify challenges across data, modeling, and deployment, and outline future directions for advancing more robust and generalizable 3D world models.

Abstract: Networks have played a pivotal role in physics, mathematics, and biology, propelling the recent revolution in artificial intelligence. This paper studies quantum field theories on networks and proposes a novel junction condition on the node. The junction condition is consistent with energy conservation in the sense that the total energy flow into the node is zero. As an application, we explore the Casimir effect on networks. Remarkably, the Casimir force on one edge can be changed from attractive to repulsive by adjusting the lengths of the other edges, providing a straightforward way to control the Casimir effect. We begin by discussing the Casimir effect for $(1+1)$-dimensional free massless scalars on a simple network. We then extend this discussion to various types of networks and higher dimensions. Finally, we offer brief comments on some open questions.

Abstract: The global demand for sustainable protein sources has accelerated the need for intelligent tools that can rapidly process and synthesise domain-specific scientific knowledge. In this study, we present a proof-of-concept multi-agent Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework designed to support sustainable protein production research, with an initial focus on microbial protein sources. Our Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-oriented system consists of two GPT-based LLM agents: (1) a literature search agent that retrieves relevant scientific literature on microbial protein production for a specified microbial strain, and (2) an information extraction agent that processes the retrieved content to extract relevant biological and chemical information. Two parallel methodologies, fine-tuning and prompt engineering, were explored for agent optimisation. Both methods demonstrated effectiveness at improving the performance of the information extraction agent in terms of transformer-based cosine similarity scores between obtained and ideal outputs. Mean cosine similarity scores were increased by up to 25%, while universally reaching mean scores of $\geq 0.89$ against ideal output text. Fine-tuning overall improved the mean scores to a greater extent (consistently of $\geq 0.94$) compared to prompt engineering, although lower statistical uncertainties were observed with the latter approach. A user interface was developed and published for enabling the use of the multi-agent AI system, alongside preliminary exploration of additional chemical safety-based search capabilities

Abstract: Recent developments in the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT) are laying the groundwork for innovative applications across the healthcare sector. Nanodevices designed to operate within the body, managed remotely via the internet, are envisioned to promptly detect and actuate on potential diseases. In this vision, an inherent challenge arises due to the limited capabilities of individual nanosensors; specifically, nanosensors must communicate with one another to collaborate as a cluster. Aiming to research the boundaries of the clustering capabilities, this survey emphasizes data-driven communication strategies in molecular communication (MC) channels as a means of linking nanosensors. Relying on the flexibility and robustness of machine learning (ML) methods to tackle the dynamic nature of MC channels, the MC research community frequently refers to neural network (NN) architectures. This interdisciplinary research field encompasses various aspects, including the use of NNs to facilitate communication in MC environments, their implementation at the nanoscale, explainable approaches for NNs, and dataset generation for training. Within this survey, we provide a comprehensive analysis of fundamental perspectives on recent trends in NN architectures for MC, the feasibility of their implementation at the nanoscale, applied explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques, and the accessibility of datasets along with best practices for their generation. Additionally, we offer open-source code repositories that illustrate NN-based methods to support reproducible research for key MC scenarios. Finally, we identify emerging research challenges, such as robust NN architectures, biologically integrated NN modules, and scalable training strategies.

https://blog.tib.eu/2025/06/26/exzellente-quantenforschung-an-der-luh/,2025-06-26 09:19:19.000,"**Exzellente (Quanten)Forschung an der Leibniz Universität Hannover**

Ende Mai ist es in einer [Pressemitteilung](https://www.uni-hannover.de/de/universitaet/aktuelles/online-aktuell/details/news/herausragender-erfolg-fuer-die-luh-drei-exzellenzcluster-bewilligt) bekannt gegeben worden: Die drei Exzellenzcluster an der Leibniz Universität Hannover (LUH) [PhoenixD](https://www.phoenixd.uni-hannover.de/de/), [QuantumFrontiers](https://www.quantumfrontiers.de/de/) und [Hearing4all.connects](https://hearing4all.de/) gehen in die Verlängerung. Herzliche Glückwünsche! Ein schöner Anlass, um hier im TIB-Blog die Exzellenzcluster mit ihren Forschungsschwerpunkten kurz vorzustellen und der Quantenphysik in ihren Forschungsinhalten nachzuspüren.

**QuantumFrontiers**

Bei **QuantumFrontiers** wird der Quantenbezug ziemlich offensichtlich im Namen des Clusters hergestellt. In der Presseinformation lesen wir über den Exzellenzcluster: „Zentrales Ziel ist, Messungen an der Quantengrenze mit bisher unerreichter Präzision durchzuführen – und sowohl die Grundlagenforschung voranzutreiben, als auch Anwendungen in der Quantentechnologie zu erschließen“ und „Mit der Quantenmetrologie dringen wir in unerforschtes Gebiet vor und erreichen nie dagewesene Präzision.“ Das zentrale Thema und gemeinsamer Nenner der sehr speziellen [Forschungsprojekte in QuantumFrontiers](https://www.quantumfrontiers.de/de/forschung/topics) ist also die Quantenmetrologie. Die Anwendungen sind dann erstaunlich vielfältig: von der Optischen Uhr über Gravitationswellendetektoren, Quantensensoren und Quantencomputern bis hin zu Kalten Atomen im Weltall, um nur einige wenige zu nennen. Salopp gesagt: Wenn die Menschheit Technologien basierend auf Quanteneffekten entwickeln und nutzen will, muss sie natürlich auch auf Quantenebene messen können!

Suche ich im [TIB-Portal nach Quantenmetrologie](https://www.tib.eu/de/suchen?tx_tibsearch_search%5Bquery%5D=quantenmetrologie&tx_tibsearch_search%5Bloc%5D=false&tx_tibsearch_search%5Bsrt%5D=rank&tx_tibsearch_search%5Bcnt%5D=20&tx_tibsearch_search%5Bst%5D=st&tx_tibsearch_search%5BgroupField%5D=matchKey&tx_tibsearch_search%5BgroupingSwitch%5D=), erlebe ich einen kleine Überraschung: Dachte ich doch, dass die Quantenmetrologie ein eher neues Thema sei, was auch die zeitliche Entwicklung der Treffer zeigt. Erst ab Mitte der 2000er Jahre steigt die jährliche Zahl der Treffer auf Werte über zehn, ab 2013 dann auf dreistellige Werte. ABER: Der Begriff Quantum Metrology wurde bereits Ende der 1960er Jahre eingeführt und bereits 1983 erschien eine umfangreiche Abhandlung mit dem Titel [Quantum Metrology and Fundamental Physical Constants](https://www.tib.eu/de/suchen/id/TIBKAT:775544949/Quantum-Metrology-and-Fundamental-Physical-Constants).

**PhoenixD**

Der Exzellenzcluster **PhoenixD** macht es mir etwas schwerer, auf den Quantenpfad zu kommen. Erstmal bin ich etwas erschlagen angesichts des Spektrums seiner Forschung unter dem Label **Ph**otonics, **O**ptics, **E**ngineering **I**nnovation – A**cross** **D**imensions. Ich irre über die PhoenixD-Website, sehe viel Optik, sehe vor allem die Beiträge aus dem Maschinenbau, der Elektrotechnik, der Werkstoffkunde und der Chemie, der Mathematik und der Informatik zu den Forschungsschwerpunkten Simulation und Fertigung in PhoenixD. Die Physik oder gar die Quantenphysik vermute ich dann in den Bereichen, die sich mit Aspekten der Licht-Materie-Wechselwirkung beschäftigen. Glücklicherweise hilft hier auch die Presseinformation weiter:

> „Ziel ist es, optische Präzisionsgeräte schnell und kostengünstig zu entwickeln, um neuartige Anwendungen in der medizinischen Diagnostik, der Lebensmittelproduktion sowie der Telekommunikation- und **Quanten**kommunikation zu ermöglichen. Dafür arbeiten Wissenschaftlerinnen und Wissenschaftler aus den sechs Fachgebieten Maschinenbau, Physik, Elektrotechnik, Informatik, Mathematik und Chemie zusammen und erforschen die Manipulation und Detektion von **Laserlicht**.“

Da sind sie, die wichtigen Begriffe Quantenkommunikation und Laserlicht, Quantenphysik und Quantenoptik! Wenn ich in [Web of  Science](https://www.tib.eu/de/suchen/id/TIBKAT:381766535/Web-of-science), einer der von der TIB für die LUH bereitgestellten Fachdatenbanken nach Veröffentlichungen des [Exzellenzclusters 2122 suche](https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/summary/3d19cda5-1ebd-41da-a4f2-2734d497ecb8-016aa2d692/relevance/1), erhalte ich 600 Treffer, die sich irgendwo in ihren Metadaten auf EXC-2122 beziehen. Jetzt geht der Spaß erst richtig los. Die Filterfunktion ermöglicht mir, diese Treffer nach bestimmten Aspekten zu analysieren:

* Aus welchen Einrichtungen stammen die Paper? LUH, TU Braunschweig, Laser Zentrum Hannover, …
* Aus welchen Departments und Instituten? Fakultät für Mathematik und Physik, Institut für Quantenoptik(!), Hannoversches Zentrum für Optische Technologien, Fakultät für Naturwissenschaften, Institut für Anorganische Chemie, Institut für Organische Chemie, Fakultät für Maschinenbau, … Tatsächlich viel Quantenoptik wenn man nach der Zahl der dem IQO zugeordneten Paper geht.
* Aus welchen WoS-Fachgebieten? Materials Science Multidisciplinary, Optics, Physics Applied, Nanoscience Nanotechnology, Chemistry Physical, Chemistry Multidisciplinary, Engineering Electrical Electronic, Physics Condensed Matter, Computer Science Artificial Intelligence, Mechanics, Mathematics Interdisciplinary Applications, … und last but not least
* Wo sind die Paper erschienen? Proceedings of SPIE, Optics Express, Sensors, Optics Letters, Scientific Reports, Carbon, Physical Review B, Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering, Physical Review A, … Dieses Ergebnis erfreut mich besonders, da ich mich vor Jahren gemeinsam mit meinen Kolleg:innen dafür eingesetzt habe, dass die [SPIE Digital Library als Allianzlizenz](https://blog.tib.eu/2024/05/21/als-open-access-ins-rollen-kam-allianz-lizenzen-im-wandel-der-zeit/) angeboten wurde, weil unser Eindruck war, dass sie u.a. in Hannover aufgrund der Forschungsschwerpunkte gut genutzt würde. Sic! Auch dass eifrig in den Journals von [Optica](https://www.tib.eu/de/publizieren-archivieren/open-access-finanzieren/open-access-angebote-nach-verlagen/optica) publiziert wird, passt.

Web of Science beantwortet auch die Frage nach den am stärksten zitierten Papern aus der Forschung von EXC-2122:

* [Exceptional piezoelectricity, high thermal conductivity and stiffness and promising photocatalysis in two-dimensional MoSi2N4 family confirmed by first-principles](https://www.tib.eu/de/suchen/id/arxiv:27609f23ddd31d4b4e4f346605efb53fe5a13cc3/Exceptional-piezoelectricity-high-thermal-conductivity?cHash=ac72545c57702ffc1137a70a05634cec)
* [Same Same But DifferNet: Semi-Supervised Defect Detection with Normalizing Flows](https://www.tib.eu/de/suchen/id/arxiv:4a34e0db053096cc863e72fb40fcb0dcbea94c38/Same-Same-But-DifferNet-Semi-Supervised-Defect?cHash=77e04483aa6ce03e3015d3ac5deafdec)

Wer eine vollständige Übersicht aller über 900 Paper von PhoenixD möchte, der sei auf die [PhoenixD-Seite im Fachinformationssystem der LUH](https://www.fis.uni-hannover.de/portal/de/organisations/phoenixd-simulation-fabrikation-und-anwendung-optischer-systeme-exzellenzcluster-2122(c385c700-5b7d-4dfd-b3c4-0976de158961).html) verwiesen. Leider ist hier die Analyse der Paper nicht so möglich wie in einschlägigen Fachdatenbanken.

**Hearing4All**

**Hearing4All,** das inzwischen seine dritte Förderperiode erreicht hat, hat zum Ziel, „die Prognose, Diagnostik und Behandlung von Hörverlust zu verbessern.“ Insbesondere die Nutzung von KI-basierten Systemem steht in der neuen Förderperiode im Fokus. Beteiligt an Hearing4All sind Wissenschaftler:innen aus der Medizinischen Physik, Psychologie, Hals-Nasen-Ohren-Heilkunde, den Neurowissenschaften, Ingenieurwissenschaften und der Linguistik.

In diesem Cluster ist die LUH nach der Carl von Ossietzky Universität Oldenburg und der Medizinischen Hochschule Hannover eher der kleine Bruder: Suche ich die Paper des Clusters in der Fachdatenbank [Scopus](https://www.tib.eu/de/suchen/id/TIBKAT:490527027/Scopus?cHash=ca71cbbb437e75f6564ca3814fa37687) an, so finde ich über 300 Treffer, die EXC-2177 als Funding information tragen. Filtere ich dann nach den Fachgebiet Physics and Astronomy, reduziert sich die Zahl der Paper auf 49, die überwiegend in Konferenzbänden oder Journals stammen, die Audio und Speech oder Acoustic im Namen tragen. Aber immerhin: Sieben der Paper haben Autor:innen, die am Institut für Quantenoptik der LUH arbeiten, eines davon hat einen Titel, der auch mir verständlich macht, was die Quantenoptik für die Forschung zur Behandlung von Hörverlust tun kann: [Optoacoustic tones generated by nanosecond laser pulses can cover the entire human hearing range](https://doi.org/10.1002/jbio.202200161).

**The Map of (Quantum) Physics**

Abstract: Multi-modal learning is a fast growing area in artificial intelligence. It tries to help machines understand complex things by combining information from different sources, like images, text, and audio. By using the strengths of each modality, multi-modal learning allows AI systems to build stronger and richer internal representations. These help machines better interpretation, reasoning, and making decisions in real-life situations. This field includes core techniques such as representation learning (to get shared features from different data types), alignment methods (to match information across modalities), and fusion strategies (to combine them by deep learning models). Although there has been good progress, some major problems still remain. Like dealing with different data formats, missing or incomplete inputs, and defending against adversarial attacks. Researchers now are exploring new methods, such as unsupervised or semi-supervised learning, AutoML tools, to make models more efficient and easier to scale. And also more attention on designing better evaluation metrics or building shared benchmarks, make it easier to compare model performance across tasks and domains. As the field continues to grow, multi-modal learning is expected to improve many areas: computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, and healthcare. In the future, it may help to build AI systems that can understand the world in a way more like humans, flexible, context aware, and able to deal with real-world complexity.

Abstract: The growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems has intensified the need for personalized learning methods that can operate efficiently and privately across heterogeneous, resource-constrained devices. However, enabling effective personalized learning in decentralized settings introduces several challenges, including efficient knowledge transfer between clients, protection of data privacy, and resilience against poisoning attacks. In this paper, we address these challenges by developing P4 (Personalized, Private, Peer-to-Peer) -- a method designed to deliver personalized models for resource-constrained IoT devices while ensuring differential privacy and robustness against poisoning attacks. Our solution employs a lightweight, fully decentralized algorithm to privately detect client similarity and form collaborative groups. Within each group, clients leverage differentially private knowledge distillation to co-train their models, maintaining high accuracy while ensuring robustness to the presence of malicious clients. We evaluate P4 on popular benchmark datasets using both linear and CNN-based architectures across various heterogeneity settings and attack scenarios. Experimental results show that P4 achieves 5% to 30% higher accuracy than leading differentially private peer-to-peer approaches and maintains robustness with up to 30% malicious clients. Additionally, we demonstrate its practicality by deploying it on resource-constrained devices, where collaborative training between two clients adds only ~7 seconds of overhead.

Abstract: Trajectory analysis is not only about obtaining movement data, but it is also of paramount importance in understanding the pattern in which an object moves through space and time, as well as in predicting its next move. Due to the significant interest in the area, data collection has improved substantially, resulting in a large number of features becoming available for training and predicting models. However, this introduces a high-dimensionality-induced feature explosion problem, which reduces the efficiency and interpretability of the data, thereby reducing the accuracy of machine learning models. To overcome this issue, feature selection has become one of the most prevalent tools. Thus, the objective of this paper was to introduce a taxonomy-based feature selection method that categorizes features based on their internal structure. This approach classifies the data into geometric and kinematic features, further categorizing them into curvature, indentation, speed, and acceleration. The comparative analysis indicated that a taxonomy-based approach consistently achieved comparable or superior predictive performance. Furthermore, due to the taxonomic grouping, which reduces combinatorial space, the time taken to select features was drastically reduced. The taxonomy was also used to gain insights into what feature sets each dataset was more sensitive to. Overall, this study provides robust evidence that a taxonomy-based feature selection method can add a layer of interpretability, reduce dimensionality and computational complexity, and contribute to high-level decision-making. It serves as a step toward providing a methodological framework for researchers and practitioners dealing with trajectory datasets and contributing to the broader field of explainable artificial intelligence.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence is producing fake remote sensing imagery (RSI) that is increasingly difficult to detect, potentially leading to erroneous intelligence, fake news, and even conspiracy theories. Existing forgery detection methods typically rely on single visual features to capture predefined artifacts, such as spatial-domain cues to detect forged objects like roads or buildings in RSI, or frequency-domain features to identify artifacts from up-sampling operations in adversarial generative networks (GANs). However, the nature of artifacts can significantly differ depending on geographic terrain, land cover types, or specific features within the RSI. Moreover, these complex artifacts evolve as generative models become more sophisticated. In short, over-reliance on a single visual cue makes existing forgery detectors struggle to generalize across diverse remote sensing data. This paper proposed a novel forgery detection framework called SFNet, designed to identify fake images in diverse remote sensing data by leveraging spatial and frequency domain features. Specifically, to obtain rich and comprehensive visual information, SFNet employs two independent feature extractors to capture spatial and frequency domain features from input RSIs. To fully utilize the complementary domain features, the domain feature mapping module and the hybrid domain feature refinement module(CBAM attention) of SFNet are designed to successively align and fuse the multi-domain features while suppressing redundant information. Experiments on three datasets show that SFNet achieves an accuracy improvement of 4%-15.18% over the state-of-the-art RS forgery detection methods and exhibits robust generalization capabilities. The code is available at <https://github.com/GeoX-Lab/RSTI/tree/main/SFNet>.

arXiv:2506.20323v1 Announce Type: new   
Abstract: This research presents the development of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) - driven crop disease detection system designed to assist farmers in rural areas with limited resources. We aim to compare different deep learning models for a comparative analysis, focusing on their efficacy in transfer learning. By leveraging deep learning models, including EfficientNet, ResNet101, MobileNetV2, and our custom CNN, which achieved a validation accuracy of 95.76%, the system effectively classifies plant diseases. This research demonstrates the potential of transfer learning in reshaping agricultural practices, improving crop health management, and supporting sustainable farming in rural environments.

""Burkina Faso STUNS the World! Built Giant Canal WITHOUT IMF, USAID, or EU!"" [19:40 min]

Quote by BCD:  
""Jun 19, 2025 Ibrahim Traoré  
Burkina Faso is building the longest irrigation canal in Africa—and it’s doing it without foreign aid, without Western oversight, and in record time. No loans. No consultants. Just concrete, water, and national will. But why is this happening now? Why is water suddenly at the center of Burkina Faso’s fight for independence? And how did one dam ignite what some are calling the most defiant infrastructure project on the continent? As the African Diaspora saying goes, ""I am because we are, and we are because I am.""

**Author(s):** [Scott Douglas Jacobsen](https://in-sightjournal.com/in-sight-people/)

*What do children really need for strong mental health development in today’s tech-driven, post-pandemic world?*

[Dr. Joshua Stein, MD](https://prairie-care.com/clinicians/joshua-stein-md/), is a board-certified Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist. He is the clinical director and an attending clinician at PrairieCare’s youth [Partial Hospital Program (PHP)](https://prairie-care.com/treatment/partial-hospital/), operating a clinic out of their [Brooklyn Park, Minnesota](https://prairie-care.com/locations/prairiecare-brooklyn-park-medical-office-building/) Medical Office Building. A graduate of Cornell University and the University of Minnesota, where he completed his psychiatry residency and fellowship, Dr. Stein is dedicated to improving the mental health of children, teens, and families. His clinical focus includes autism, anxiety, OCD, and depression, with an emphasis on long-term functional outcomes. As president of the Minnesota Society for Child Adolescent Psychiatry, he advocates for greater access to care. He has been recognized as a Top Doctor by Minneapolis St. Paul Magazine and Minnesota Monthly.

**Scott Douglas Jacobsen:** What does clinical work reveal as the fundamental psychological needs of children today?

**Dr. Joshua Stein:** Children need the opportunity to face increasingly difficult obstacles to build industry, purpose, talent and initiative. In my practice, I compare this to learning how to read. To explain: initially we need to learn the alphabet, then sound out short words, put them in sentences, and finally read paragraphs and chapters. If we do not learn the basics of reading, imagine how complex a high school English class would be.

From a psychological perspective, children need to be able to face age-appropriate challenges and learn how to manage them. That way, by the time they are young adults, they are able to juggle the complexities of high school life.

During the pandemic, out of the natural instinct to protect, many kids were not given the opportunity to face developmentally appropriate challenges. For example, they did not learn to detach in preschool or stand up to the third grade bully. They did not have to sit uncomfortably behind someone they were attracted to in seventh grade, experience what it’s like to not get the role they wanted in drama class, or the ability to increase practice intensity in sports. The opportunity cost of the COVID-era and its lasting ripples has led to social stagnation and missed psychological developmental milestones. We are seeing college students who operate as early high schoolers, high schoolers who act like they are in junior high, and so on.

**Jacobsen:** How does this change in the digital world?

**Stein:** There will always be a generational fear of change and the unknown. In the 60s, it was Elvis’s hips, and in the 80s, it was the war on drugs. Now, as technology moves faster than ever, we are seeing growing dependence on social media and screens in new and challenging ways, and this is occurring at a developmentally critical time for kids who need to face and overcome challenges in their real, offscreen lives. So many kids doomscroll instead of tolerating hard feelings. When things get difficult, they turn to easy distractions online. They also face the challenges of online personas and cyber bullying. Increasing numbers of kids are giving up parts of their own life to watch 6-second clips of other people’s idealized lives. I avoid fearmongering in my work, but I am concerned with increasing patterns of aimlessness and the technology dependence that go hand-in-hand. This generation was undermined by the pandemic and that is further exploited by the digital era. It is critical that they have offline lives and learn how to do hard or challenging things.

**Jacobsen:** How can parents and caregivers identify early signs of a struggle with mental health?

**Stein:** Children often display emerging mental health concerns in their patterns and body complaints. We commonly see changes to sleep routine, impairment in concentration, school refusal, and irritability as initial signs and symptoms of mental health concerns. They may describe upset stomach indigestion or start to use the bathroom excessively. Kids hold their anxiety in their bodies and often do not yet have the language to define what is happening to them. Additionally, patterns of depression are often atypical in children. Unlike adults who are often depressed across all areas of their life, children may still enjoy their favorite things, even if they feel depressed. They may laugh with their friends, succeed in their sport, and be thrilled to go to a favorite activity. Then, in quiet moments, they may be sullen, more emotional, or easily distressed. These inconsistencies are often signs of emerging childhood depression.

**Jacobsen:** What practices are effective in fostering resilience and mental health in children?

**Stein:** My primary recommendation is that parents monitor their own mental health needs to set a good example for their child. Parents should be reflective of their own emotions and be intentional about naming challenges or difficulties in their own feelings regularly. This provides insight and a scaffold for children to learn. Additionally, pushing kids to try things outside their comfort zone in small sips and gulps is warranted. This allows them to build industry and self-worth, to tackle hard things so they know what they can and cannot do, and learn how to ask for help when needed. In the digital age, as parents, we are strikingly aware of all that can go wrong. Our own anxieties can lead to being overprotective and helicoptering. We need to allow our kids to grow so that they feel confident in fighting their own battles. Try asking your child, “How would you like to handle this?” and tackle things together.

**Jacobsen:** How does screen time impact the mental health of young people?

**Stein:** This is a notable and incredibly complex subject. In some ways, social media and screens are incredibly helpful. They allow connection and exploration of shared interests that used to be done in isolation. On the other hand, we know that excessive social media time—somewhere between 3-5 hours a day—worsens mental health outcomes, including increased suicidal thoughts, self-harm, and negative self-image. Studies have shown that placing limits on social media time greatly improves general wellbeing. Interestingly, if you ask teenagers, they are strikingly aware of the harms of social media. They also struggle to set their own limits on their screen time. It is important to support them by modeling healthy screen time behavior and setting the limits that our children crave so that they can be successful and experience all of the other joys in life.

**Jacobsen:** How can schools and community programs support children’s mental well-being?

**Stein:** Fortunately, we are seeing a lot of advancement in schools’ awareness and engagement regarding mental health. I think creating phone-free zones would be strikingly helpful. Studies show that excess screen use has led to attention issues in older teenagers and distract kids from the school day. By creating a sanctuary in the school where phones are only available during passing time, or are not available until the end of the day, there is a true opportunity to improve wellbeing.

**Jacobsen:** How can caregivers distinguish between regular developmental behaviors and symptoms of serious mental health conditions?

**Stein:** My advice is to trust your gut. If something seems off with your child, their irritability is severe, or sleep-wake schedule is abnormal, check in. Caregivers often delay care because they feel their only option is to see a psychiatrist or mental health professional. My colleagues in pediatrics and family practice are excellent in starting care, and a large part of their practice relates to mental wellbeing. They can help families understand the difference between normative development and concerning features of anxiety, depression or mood disorders. So check in with your family doctor if you are concerned.

**Jacobsen:** In leading youth services at PrairieCare, what innovations excite you?

**Stein:** There are a couple advancements that profoundly excite me. The first is a silver lining from the pandemic. Virtual health care has allowed the expansion of mental health resources into all corners of our country. It has stopped the geographic disparity that too often led to underprivileged children not being able to get care. At PrairieCare, due to the pandemic, we built out extensive online resources that allow kids to participate in groups or see their physician from their home setting. This is an excellent resource, and many teenagers find it more comfortable and collaborative in their own care.

Additionally, in the near future, artificial intelligence is going to let your doctor be more present and less focused on charting and note writing. Resources like ambient AI will be able to monitor the conversation, take notes, prepare prescriptions, etc. As we implement this in our practice at PrairieCare, I am excited for the burden of charting to decrease so the joy of healing and interacting with my patients can increase.

All three of the largest AI labs now have their own version of what I am calling a ""terminal agent"" - a CLI tool that can read and write files and execute commands on your behalf in the terminal.

I'm honestly a little surprised at how significant this category has become: I had assumed that terminal tools like this would always be something of a niche interest, but given the number of people I've heard from spending hundreds of dollars a month on Claude Code this niche is clearly larger and more important than I had thought!

I had a few days of early access to the Gemini one. It's very good - it takes advantage of Gemini's million token context and has good taste in things like when to read a file and when to run a command.

Like OpenAI Codex and unlike Claude Code it's open source (Apache 2) - the full source code can be found in google-gemini/gemini-cli on GitHub. The core system prompt lives in core/src/core/prompts.ts - I've extracted that out as a rendered Markdown Gist.""

Привет, Хабр! Меня зовут Александр, я лидер команды DevSup (это как DevOps, только с функцией поддержки больших клиентов которым Saas не подходит) в IT-компании ПравоТех. Мы создаем решения (например, case.one для ведения дел и doc.one для документооборота), чтобы юристы, менеджеры и все кто рядом с юриспруденцией могли работать быстрее, умнее и спокойнее. Наша миссия – «Помогаем людям получать удовольствие от работы». Сейчас у нас активно внедряются ИИ-инструменты. Создаются боты для консультаций и опросов, часто обращаемся к большим моделям чтобы «обстучать» какую-то идею. В этой статье поделюсь историей о том, как эффективно и безопасно использовать ИИ, превратив рутину в решенную задачу. Итак, представьте: вам в руки попадает договор поставки ПО. Не просто договор, а целая книжечка на 50-70 страниц А4. Нужно срочно – за 2-3 дня! – проанализировать его вдоль и поперек: проверить сроки, штрафы, бонусы, риски для вашей компании. Знакомая ситуация для менеджеров, юристов, закупщиков? Дилемма: Выкроить время и вычитать всё дотошно, рискуя не успеть? Или пробежаться по диагонали, надеясь, что глаз «зацепит» опасную формулировку? Соблазн велик: закинуть текст в публичный ИИ-чат (типа ChatGPT или DeepSeek) и спросить: «Эй, ИИ, моя компания ООО «Рога и копыта» – найди всё, что нам невыгодно!» Цена такого «упрощения» может быть огромной. Давайте разберемся, почему это крайне опасно : 1. Конфиденциальность — прощай! Условия договора (а они почти всегда секретны!) отправляются владельцу ИИ-сервиса. Нарушение пункта о неразглашении – гарантировано.
